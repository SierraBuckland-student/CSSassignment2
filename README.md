MODULE Two Project - AwesomeFest WebSIte Revamp

In Module Two, we dove deeper into the speciﬁcs of CSS, as we well as the considerations we need to make as interface designers in order to create interfaces that are visually compelling, user-friendly and accessible for all users.

Your Task:

A company who will be hosting a music festival in Barrie this summer would like to hire you to help them complete the Awesomefest Music Festival website. Their previous developer started the design and development of the site, but the company was not happy with the results produced. Using the ﬁles created by the previous developer as a starting point, complete the following:

Speciﬁc Requirements:

1.) ensure that all CSS and HTML is valid, well-formatted, error-free and includes helpful comments where applicable.

2.) Add a background image to the header that covers the entire element. Your client would like the background to remain ﬁxed when the background scrolls.

3.) Ensure that the images in the .images section ﬁll the width of their parent elements.

4.) Create an HTML form that include ﬁelds speciﬁed by your client (you will ﬁnd these in the HTML ﬁle added as a comment) 5.) Style the table and the form so that they are attractive, follow best practices and are easy to read/understand.

6.) Ensure that the website displays consistently across all major browsers (Firefox, Chrome, IE, Edge - particularly the table and the form)

** Remember, you are always welcome to go above and beyond project expectations and add your own creative touches. Look at other music festival websites to get ideas & inspiration.
